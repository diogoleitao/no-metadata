<h1>Understanding FAT32 Filesystems</h1>

This page is intended to help you understand how to access data
on Microsoft FAT32 filesystems, commonly used on hard drives
ranging in size from 500 megs to hundreds of gigabytes.  FAT is
a relatively simple and unsophisticated filesystem that is
understood by nearly all operating systems, including Linux and
MacOS, so it's usually a common choice for firmware-based projects
that need to access hard drives.  FAT16 and FAT12 are very similar
and used on smaller disks.  This page will concentrate on FAT32
only (to keep it simple), and briefly mention where
these other two are different.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/fatgen.mspx">
official
FAT specification is available from Microsoft</a>, complete with a
software "license agreement".  Saddly, the document
from Microsoft is hard to read if you do not already understand the FAT
filesystem structure, and it lacks information about disk partitioning
which also must be dealt with to properly use standard hard drives.  While
you may find the Microsoft spec useful, this page is meant to "stand alone"...
and you can simply read it without suffering through 3 pages of legalese!
<p>
However, this page will intentionally "gloss over" many small details
and omit many of the finer points, in an attempt to keep it simple and
easy to read for anyone faced with learning FAT32 without any previous
exposure.

<h2>Where To Start... How About At The Beginning?</h2>

The first sector of the drive is called the Master Boot Record (MBR).
You can read it with LBA = 0.  For any new projects, you should not
even worry about accessing a drive in CHS mode, as LBA just numbers
the sectors sequentially starting at zero, which is much simpler.
All IDE drives support accessing sectors using LBA.  Also, all IDE
drives use sectors that are 512 bytes.  Recent Microsoft operating
systems refer to using larger sectors, but the drives still use 512
bytes per sector and MS is just treating multiple sectors as if they
were one sector.  The remainder of this page will only refer to LBA
address of 512 byte sectors.
<p>
The first 446 bytes of the MBR are code that boots the computer.
This is followed by a 64 byte partition table, and the last two
bytes are always 0x55 and 0xAA.  You should always check these
last two bytes, as a simple "sanity check" that the MBR is ok.
<p>
<table width=262 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/mbr.gif" width=250 height=300 alt="MBR Diagrag"><br>
<small><b>Figure 1</b>: MBR (first sector) layout</small></td></tr></table>

<p>
The MBR can only represent four partitions.  A technique called "extended"
partitioning is used to allow more than four, and often times it
is used when there are more than two partitions.  All we're going
to say about extended partitions is that they appear in this table
just like a normal partition, and their first sector has another
partition table that describes the partitions within its space.
But for the sake of simply getting some code to work, we're going
to not worry about extended partitions (and repartition and reformat
any drive that has them....)  The most common scenario is only one
partition using the whole drive, with partitions 2, 3 and 4 blank.
<p>
Each partition description is just 16 bytes, and the good news is
that you can usually just ignore most of them.  The fifth byte is
a <i>Type Code</i> that tells
what type of filesystem is supposed to be contained within the
partition, and the ninth through twelth bytes indicate the <i>LBA
Begin</i>
address where that partition begins on the disk.
<p>

<table width=480 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/partition.gif" width=469 height=42 alt="Partition Entry"><br>
<small><b>Figure 2</b>: 16-byte partition entry</small></td></tr></table>

<p>
Normally you only need to check the <i>Type Code</i> of each entry,
looking for either 0x0B or 0x0C (the two that are used for FAT32),
and then read the <i>LBA Begin</i> to learn where the FAT32 filesystem
is located on the disk.
<p>
TODO: add a table of known type codes, with the FAT32 ones colored
<p>



<table align=right width="30%" cellspacing=4 cellpadding=10>
<tr bgcolor="#e8e8e8"><td>
<center><h3>Winhex Warning</h3></center>
Several people have attempted to read the MBR (LBA=0) with Winhex,
and actually ended up reading the FAT Volume ID sector.  When using
Winhex, sector addressing may be relative to your windows partition.
</td></tr></table>


<p>
The <i>Number of Sectors</i> field can be checked to make sure you
do not access (particularly write) beyond the end of the space that
is allocated for the parition.  However, the FAT32 filesystem itself
contains information about its size, so this <i>Number of Sectors</i>
field is redundant.  Several of Microsoft's operating systems ignore
it and instead rely on the size information embedded within the first
sector of the filesystem.  (yes, I have experimentally verified this,
though unintentionally :)
Linux checks the <i>Number of Sectors</i> field and properly prevents
access beyond the allocated space.  Most firmware will probably ignore it.
<p>
The Boot Flag, CHS Begin, and CHS End fields should be ignored.


<h2>FAT32 Volume ID... Yet Another First Sector</h2>

The first step to reading the FAT32 filesystem is the read its
first sector, called the Volume ID.  The Volume ID is read
using the LBA Begin address found from the partition table.
From this sector, you will extract information that tells you
everything you need to know about the physical layout of the
FAT32 filesystem.
<p>
Microsoft's specification lists many variables, and the FAT32
Volume ID is slightly different than the older ones used for FAT16
and FAT12.  Fortunately, most of the information is not needed
for simple code.  Only four variables are required, and three
others should be checked to make sure they have the expected values.
<p>
<table width=262 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/volume_id.gif" width=250 height=300 alt="Volume ID Diagram"><br>
<small><b>Figure 4</b>: FAT32 Volume ID, critical fields</small></td></tr></table>
<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 align=center>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Microsoft's Name</th><th>Offset</th><th>Size</th><th>Value</th></tr>

<tr><td>Bytes Per Sector</td><td>BPB_BytsPerSec</td><td>0x0B</td><td align=right>16 Bits</td><td>Always 512 Bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sectors Per Cluster</td><td>BPB_SecPerClus</td><td>0x0D</td><td align=right>8 Bits</td><td>1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of Reserved Sectors</td><td>BPB_RsvdSecCnt</td><td>0x0E</td><td align=right>16 Bits</td><td>Usually 0x20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of FATs</td><td>BPB_NumFATs</td><td>0x10</td><td align=right>8 Bits</td><td>Always 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sectors Per FAT</td><td>BPB_FATSz32</td><td>0x24</td><td>32 Bits</td><td align=right>Depends on disk size</td></tr>
<tr><td>Root Directory First Cluster</td><td>BPB_RootClus</td><td>0x2C</td><td align=right>32 Bits</td><td>Usually 0x00000002</td></tr>
<tr><td>Signature</td><td>(none)</td><td>0x1FE</td><td align=right>16 Bits</td><td>Always 0xAA55</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

After checking the three fields to make sure the filesystem is using
512 byte sectors, 2 FATs, and has a correct signature, you may want to
"boil down" these variables read from the MBR and Volume ID into just
four simple numbers that are needed for accessing the FAT32 filesystem.
Here are simple formulas in C syntax:
<p>
<pre>
(unsigned long)fat_begin_lba = Partition_LBA_Begin + Number_of_Reserved_Sectors;
(unsigned long)cluster_begin_lba = Partition_LBA_Begin + Number_of_Reserved_Sectors + (Number_of_FATs * Sectors_Per_FAT);
(unsigned char)sectors_per_cluster = BPB_SecPerClus;
(unsigned long)root_dir_first_cluster = BPB_RootClus;
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, most of the information is needed only to learn the
location of the first cluster and the FAT.  You will need to remember
the size of the clusters and where the root directory is located, but
the other information is usually not needed (at least for simply reading
files).
<p>
If you compare these formulas to the ones in Microsoft's specification,
you should notice two differences.  They lack "RootDirSectors", because
FAT32 stores the root directory the same way as files and subdirectories,
so RootDirSectors is always zero with FAT32.  For FAT16 and FAT12, this
extra step is needed to compute the special space allocated for the root
directory.
<p>
Microsoft's formulas do not show the "Partition_LBA_Begin" term.  Their
formulas are all relative to the beginning of the filesystem, which they
don't explicitly state very well.  You must add the "Partition_LBA_Begin"
term found from the MBR to compute correct LBA addresses for the IDE
interface, because to the drive the MBR is at zero, not the Volume ID.
Not adding Partition_LBA_Begin is one of the most common errors most
developers make, so especially if you are using Microsoft's spec, do not
forget to add this for correct LBA addressing.
<p>
The rest of this page will usually refer to "fat_begin_lba", "cluster_begin_lba",
"sectors_per_cluster", and "root_dir_first_cluster", rather than the
individual fields from the MBR and Volume ID, because it is easiest to
compute these numbers when starting up and then you no longer need all the
details from the MBR and Volume ID.




<table align=right width="30%" cellspacing=4 cellpadding=10>
<tr bgcolor="#e8e8e8"><td>
<center><h3>Bad Sectors</h3></center>
In the old days, disk drives had "bad" sectors.
Brand new drives would often have several bad sectors,
and as the drive was used (or abused), additional
sectors would become unusable.
<p>
The FAT filesystems are designed to handle bad
sectors.  This is done by storing two identical copies
of the File Allocation Table.  The idea is that if a
sector within one FAT becomes bad, the corresponding
sector in the other FAT will (hopefully) still be good.
<p>
Bad sectors within the clusters are handled by storing
a special code within the FAT entry that represents the
cluster that contains the bad sector.  If a file happened
to be using that cluster, well, you lost part of the
file's data, but at least that cluster would be marked
as bad so that it would never be used again.  The initial
formatting of the disk would write and read every sector and
mark the bad clusters before they could be used, so data
loss could only occur when a previously-good sector
became bad.
<p>
Fortunately, bad sectors today are only a distant memory,
at least on hard drives.
Modern drives still internally experience media errors,
but they store
<a href="http://www.siam.org/siamnews/mtc/mtc193.htm">Reed-Solomon
error correcting codes</a> for every sector.  Sector data can
be interleaved and distributed over a wide area, so a physical
defect (localized to one place) can damage only a small part of
many sectors, rather than all of a few sectors.  The error
correction can easily recover the few missing bits of each sector.
Error correction also dramatically increases
storage capacity (despite using space to store redundant data),
because the bits can be packed so close
together that a small number of errors begin to occur, and
the error correction fixes them.
<p>
All modern drives also include extra storage capacity that
is used to
<a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/format_Defect.htm">automatically
remap damaged sectors</a>.  When a sector
is read and too many of the bits needed error correction, the
controller in the drive will "move" that sector to a fresh portion
of the space set aside for remapping sectors.  Remapping also
dramatically reduces the cost of disk drives, because small
but common defects in manufacturing don't impact overall
product quality.
<p>
Because all modern drives use sophisticated error correction to
automatically detect and (almost always) correct for media errors,
bad sectors are virtually never seen at the IDE interface level.

<h2>How The FAT32 Filesystem Is Arranged</h2>

The layout of a FAT32 filesystem is simple.  The first sector is
always the Volume ID, which is followed by some unused space
called the reserved sectors.  Following the reserved sectors are
two copies of the FAT (File Allocation Table).  The remainder
of the filesystem is data arranged in "clusters", with perhaps
a tiny bit of unused space after the last cluster.

<p>
<table width=432 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat32_layout.gif" width=420 height=300 alt="Filesystem Layout Diagrag"><br>
<small><b>Figure 5</b>: FAT32 Filesystem Overall Layout</small></td></tr></table>
<p>

The vast majority of the disk space is the clusters section,
which is used to hold all the files and directories.  The
clusters begin their numbering at 2, so there is no cluster #0
or cluster #1.  To access any particular cluster, you need to
use this formula to turn the cluster number into the LBA address
for the IDE drive:
<p>
<code>lba_addr = cluster_begin_lba + (cluster_number - 2) * sectors_per_cluster;</code>
<p>
Normally clusters are at least 4k (8 sectors), and sizes of 8k, 16k and
32k are also widely used.  Some later versions of Microsoft Windows allow
using even larger cluster sizes, by effectively considering the sector
size to be some mulitple of 512 bytes.  The FAT32 specification from
Microsoft states that 32k is the maximum cluster size.


<h2>Now If Only We Knew Where The Files Were....</h2>

When you begin, you only know the first cluster of the root directory.
Reading the directory will reveal the names and first cluster location
of other files and subdirectories.  A key point is that
<font color="#B00000"><b>directories only tell you how to find the first cluster number of their files
and subdirectories</b></font>.  You also obtain a variety of other info
from the directory such as the file's length, modification time, attribute
bits, etc, but a directory only tells you where the files begin.  To
access more than the first cluster, you will need to use the FAT.  But
first we need to be able to find where those files start.
<p>
In this section, we'll only briefly look at directories as much as
is necessary to learn where the files are, then we'll look at how
to access the rest of a file using the FAT,
and later we'll revisit directory structure in more detail.
<p>
Directory data is organized in 32 byte records.  This is nice, because
any sector holds exactly 16 records, and no directory record will ever
cross a sector boundry.  There are four types of 32-byte directory
records.
<ol>
<li><b>Normal record with short filename</b> - Attrib is normal
<li><b>Long filename text</b> - Attrib has all four type bits set
<li><b>Unused</b> - First byte is 0xE5
<li><b>End of directory</b> - First byte is zero
</ol>
Unused directory records are a result of deleting files.  The first byte
is overwritten with 0xE5, and later when a new file is created it can be
reused.  At the end of the directory is a record that begins with zero.
All other records will be non-zero in their first byte, so this is an
easy way to determine when you have reached the end of the directory.
<p>
Records that do not begin with 0xE5 or zero are actual directory data, and
the format can be determined by checking the Attrib byte.  For now, we are
only going to be concerned with the normal directory records that have
the old 8.3 short filename format.  In FAT32, all files and subdirectories
have short names, even if the user gave the file a longer name, so you can
access all files without needing to decode the long filename records (as long
as your code simply ignores them).  Here is the format of a normal
directory record:

<p>
<table width=592 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/dir_entry_short.gif" width=581 height=52 alt="Short Directory Entry"><br>
<small><b>Figure 6</b>: 32 Byte Directory Structure, Short Filename Format</small></td></tr></table>
<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 align=center>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Microsoft's Name</th><th>Offset</th><th>Size</th></tr>

<tr><td>Short Filename</td><td>DIR_Name</td><td>0x00</td><td align=right>11 Bytes</th></tr>
<tr><td>Attrib Byte</td><td>DIR_Attr</td><td>0x0B</td><td align=right>8 Bits</td></tr>
<tr><td>First Cluster High</td><td>DIR_FstClusHI</td><td>0x14</td><td align=right>16 Bits</td></tr>
<tr><td>First Cluster Low</td><td>DIR_FstClusLO</td><td>0x1A</td><td align=right>16 Bits</td></tr>
<tr><td>File Size</td><td>DIR_FileSize</td><td>0x1C</td><td align=right>32 Bits</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

The Attrib byte has six bits defined, as shown in the table below.  Most
simple firmware will check the Attrib byte to determine if the 32 bytes are
a normal record or long filename data, and to determine if it is a normal
file or a subdirectory.  Long filename records have all four of the least
significant bits set.  Normal files rarely have any of these four bits set.

The remaining fields are relatively simple and straigforward.
The first 11 bytes are the short filename (old 8.3 format).  The extension
is always the last three bytes.  If the file's name is shorter than 8 bytes,
the unused bytes are filled with spaces (0x20).  The starting cluster number
is found as two 16 bit sections, and the file size (in bytes) is found in the
last four bytes of the record.  In both, the least significant byte is first.
The first cluster number tells you where the file's data begins on the drive,
and the size field tells you how long the file is  The actual space allocated
on the disk will be an integer number of clusters, so the file size lets you
know how much of the last cluster is the file's data.


<h2>File Allocation Table - Following Cluster Chains</h2>


The directory entries tell you where the first cluster of each file (or
subdirectory) is located on the disk, and of course you find the first
cluster of the root directory from the volume ID sector.
For tiny files and directories (that fit inside
just one cluster), the only information you obtain from the FAT is
that there are no more clusters for that file.
To access all the other clusters of
a file beyond the first one, you need to use the File Allocation Table.  The name FAT32 refers
to this table, and the fact that each entry of the table is 32 bits.  In
FAT16 and FAT12, the entries are 16 and 12 bits.  FAT16 and FAT12 work the
same way as FAT32 (with the unpleasant exception that 12 bit entries do not
always fall neatly within sector boundries, but 16 and 32 bit entries never
cross sector boundries).  We're only going to look at FAT32.
<p>
The File Allocation Table is a big array of 32 bit integers, where each
one's position in the array corresponds to a cluster number, and the
value stored indicates the next cluster in that file.  The purpose of
the FAT is to tell you where the next cluster of a file is located on
the disk, when you know where the current cluster is at.  Every sector of
of the FAT holds 128 of these 32 bit integers, so looking up the next
cluster of a file is relatively easy.  Bits 7-31 of the current cluster
tell you which sectors to read from the FAT, and bits 0-6 tell you which
of the 128 integers in that sector contain is the number of the next
cluster of your file (or if all ones, that the current cluster is the last).
<p>
Here is a visual example of three small files and a root directory, all
allocated near within first several clusters (so that one one sector of
the FAT is needed for the drawing).  Please note that in this example,
the root directory is 5 clusters... a very unlikely scenario for a drive
with only 3 files.  The idea is to show how to follow cluster chains, but
please keep in mind that a small root directory (in only 1 cluster) would
have "FFFFFFFF" at position 2 (or whereever the volume ID indicated as
the first cluster), rather than "00000009" leading to even more clusters.
However, with more files, the root directory would likely span several
clusters, and rarely would a root directory occupy consecutive clusters
due to all the allocation for files written before the directory grew to
use more clusters.  With that caveat in mind, here's that simple example:

<p>
<table width=472 align=center><tr><td><img src="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat_sector.gif" width=460 height=309 alt="FAT Sector Diagram"><br>
<small><b>Figure 7</b>: FAT32 Sector, Cluster chains for root directory and three files</small></td></tr></table>
<p>

In this example, the root directory begins at cluster 2, which is learned
from the Volume ID.  The number at position 2 in the FAT has a 9, so the
second cluster is #9.  Likewise, clusters A, B, and 11 hold the remainder
of the root directory.  The number at position 11 has 0xFFFFFFFF which
indicates that this is the last cluster of the root directory.  In
practice, your code may not even attempt to read position 11 because the
an end-of-directory marker (first of 32 bytes is zero) would be found.
Likewise, a filesystem with a small root directory might fit entirely
into one cluster, and the FAT could not be needed at all to read such a
directory.  But if you reach the end of the 32 byte entries within the
first cluster without finding the end-of-directory marker, then the FAT
must be used to find the remaining clusters.
<p>
Similarly, three files are shown.  In each case, the FAT gives no
indication of which cluster is the first... that must be extracted from
the directory, and then the FAT is used to access subsequent clusters
of the file.  The number of clusters allocated to the file should
always be enough to hold the number of bytes specified by the size
field in the directory.  A portion of the last cluster will be unused,
except in the rare case where the file's size is an exact multiple of
the cluster size.  Files that are zero length do not have any clusters
allocated to them, and the cluster number in the directory should be zero.
Files that fit into just one cluster will have only the "FFFFFFFF"
end of file marker in the FAT at their cluster position.
<p>
<b>Shortcut Hint:</b> One approach to the simplest possible code is to keep
the root directory very small (few files, only 8.3 filenames), avoid
subdirectories, and run
the "defrag" program on a PC.  That way, the root directory is found in
just one cluster and every file occupies only consecutive clusters.
Though this approach is very limiting, it means you can read files
without using the FAT at all.
<p>
According to Microsoft's spec, the cluster numbers are really only 28 bits
and the upper 4 bits of a cluster are "reserved".  You should clear those
top for bits to zeros before depending on a cluster number.  Also, the
end-of-file number is actually anything equal to or greater than 0xFFFFFFF8,
but in practive 0xFFFFFFFF is always written.  Zeros in the FAT mark
clusters that are free space.  Also, please remember that the cluster
numbers are stored with their least significant byte first (Figure 7
shows them human-readable formatted, but they are actually stored LSB first).
<p>
The good news for a firmware designer working with limited resources is
that FAT is really very simple.  However, FAT's simplicity is also its
weakness as a general purpose file system for high performance computing.
For example, to append data to a file, the operating system must traverse
the entire cluster chain.  Seeking to random places within a file also
requires many reads within the FAT.  For the sake of comparison,
unix filesystems use a tree-like
structure, where a cluster (also called a "block") has either a list of
blocks (often called "inode" in unix terminology), or a list of other
inodes which in turn point to blocks.  In this manner, the location on
disk of any block can be found by reading 1, 2, or 3 (for huge files)
inodes.  The other weakness of FAT, which is mitigated by caching, is
that it is physically located near the "beginning" of the disk, rather
than physically distributed.  Unix inode-based filesystems scatter the
inode blocks evenly among the data blocks, and attempt to describe the
location of data using nearby inode blocks.


<h2>Directories and Long Filenames In Detail</h2>

<blockquote>
TODO: write this section someday.... the basic idea is that a bunch of
32-byte entries preceeding the normal one are used to hold the long name
that corresponds to that normal directory record.
</blockquote>


<h2>Where's the Free Code ???</h2>

At this time, I do not have a free general-purpose FAT32 code library
for you to easily drop into your project.
<p>
However, you can find FAT32 code in the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/tech/mp3/">mp3 player project</a>.
The 0.1.x and 0.5.x firmware used a simple one-sector-at-a-time approach
that is very easy to understand and only needs a single 512 byte buffer,
but is not very sophisticated.  These old firmware revs do not properly
follow cluster chains for file (they do for directories), so it is necessary
to run defrag before using the drive with them.
<p>
The 0.6.x mp3 player firmware does use the FAT properly to follow cluster
chains.  It uses megabytes of memory from the SIMM to buffer cluster and
sectors from the FAT.  A table of recently read FAT sectors is maintained,
and a binary search is implemented to quickly locate the memory associated
with any cached FAT sector.  The firmware manages the megabytes of RAM by
dividing it into 4k chunks (which works together with the bank swapping
implemented by the FPGA), and the first 32 hold a big array of 16-byte
structs with info about what is held in each 4k block.  These structs
implement linked lists that for each file cached in memory.  A file I/O
API is built on top of this to allow the main program to access the cached
data.  The 0.6.x firmware also uses DMA, so data transfers are quite fast.
<p>
Both of the MP3 player project FAT32 implementations are read-only.  Both
are GPL'd, but both are quite specific to that project.  You can choose
either very simple without features and needing defrag, or quite complex
with lots of features but heavily dependent on the FPGA and SIMM.
<p>
Perhaps someday I will write a more general purpose FAT32 implementation
with nice documentation for this code library section.  But this is not
planned for the near future.  Hopefully the description on this page
will at least help you to understand how FAT32 works so you can write
your own code or understand the project-specific code in the mp3 players.

<h2>Please Help....</h2>

If you have found this web page helpful, please create a direct link on your
own project webpage (hopefully with at least "FAT32" in your link text).
Visitors to your site
will be able to find this page, and your link will help search engines
to direct other developers searching for FAT32 information to this
page.
<p>
Understanding FAT32 can be difficult, especially if you can only find
poorly written documentation like Microsoft's specification.  I wrote
this page to help bridge the gap and make understanding FAT32 easier.
Please help make it easier for others to find it.
<p>
Thanks.
